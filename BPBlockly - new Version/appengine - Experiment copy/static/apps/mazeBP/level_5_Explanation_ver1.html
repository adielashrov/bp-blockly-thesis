      In this level we have seen two scenarios.</br></br>
	  The first scenario is responsible for handling a left turn.</br>
	  The scenario waits for the event, 'path left' and then requests to 'turn left' and 'move forward'.</br>
    </p>
		<!--<img src="../../media/level5_part1.JPG">-->
    <p>
	  <!--When this event is initiated the scenario is notified and can continue with it's execution.</br>-->
	  The second scenario is responsible for moving the pegman forward.<br>
    </p>
		<!--<img src="../../media/level5_part2.JPG">-->
    <p>
		The 'turn left' event has a higher priority than 'move forward'. 
		Therefore when both events are requested the turn event is triggered.
		
		<!--In this maze layout it is preferable to make a turn when possible.<br>
		Therefore a <em>turn left/right</em> event is in a higher priority than <em>move forward</em>, 
		That is if both a <em>turn left/right</em> and a <em>move forward</em> are possible,the turn event will be initiated.-->

      Let's continue to the next level!
